# Myomectomy Market Forecast 2025–2035: Trends, Insights, and Opportunities

The global [myomectomy market]([url](https://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/myomectomy-market.html)) is poised for substantial growth in the coming decade, driven by rising awareness of uterine fibroids and increasing preference for fertility-preserving treatments. Valued at **USD 642.1 million in 2024**, the market is projected to expand at a **compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7.5%** and is expected to reach **USD 1,430.7 million by 2035**. This robust growth reflects not only advancements in surgical technology but also evolving patient preferences, particularly among women in their reproductive years.

## Understanding Myomectomy and Its Growing Demand

Myomectomy is a surgical procedure aimed at removing uterine fibroids while preserving the uterus. Unlike hysterectomy, which involves removing the entire uterus, myomectomy retains a woman’s ability to conceive, making it the preferred option for those who wish to maintain fertility. As fibroids can cause heavy menstrual bleeding, pelvic pain, and fertility complications, many women—especially between the ages of 30 and 50—seek timely intervention.

Three major types of myomectomy procedures are commonly performed:

- **Open Myomectomy**
- **Laparoscopic Myomectomy**
- **Hysteroscopic Myomectomy**

Recently, **robotic-assisted laparoscopic myomectomy** has also gained attention for its precision and quicker recovery time. Open myomectomy remains the most widely used approach, particularly in cases involving multiple or large fibroids.

## Key Drivers Fueling Market Expansion

One of the primary growth drivers of the myomectomy market is the **increasing prevalence of uterine fibroids**. According to research, up to **80% of women will develop fibroids by the age of 50**. The rising number of gynecological check-ups, combined with the adoption of advanced diagnostic tools like **MRI and transvaginal ultrasound**, is enabling earlier and more accurate diagnosis.

A growing trend favoring **uterus-sparing procedures** is also boosting demand. With more women choosing to delay pregnancy, there is heightened interest in fertility-preserving options. This has created a fertile ground for **minimally invasive myomectomy technologies**, such as laparoscopic and robotic-assisted surgeries. However, the adoption of these high-end solutions is often limited by **cost and access**, particularly in low- and middle-income countries.

## Open Myomectomy: The Gold Standard

Despite the increasing popularity of minimally invasive techniques, **open myomectomy continues to dominate the market**. This is largely due to its effectiveness in complex cases involving large or deeply embedded fibroids. It also provides **superior visibility and control** for surgeons, making it a safer option in many challenging scenarios.

According to a **2023 study published in *Obstetrics & Gynecology International***, **65% of surgeries** performed for fibroids larger than 8 cm were done via open procedures. These figures highlight the ongoing reliance on traditional surgical methods, especially in regions with limited access to cutting-edge technologies.

## Regional Outlook: North America Leads the Charge

**North America** currently holds the largest share of the global myomectomy market and is expected to maintain its leadership throughout the forecast period. This dominance is attributed to several factors:

- High disease prevalence
- Well-established healthcare infrastructure
- Widespread adoption of robot-assisted surgical technologies

Within North America, the **United States** stands out due to a higher prevalence of fibroids among **African-American women**, who are disproportionately affected and often require earlier and more aggressive treatment. Furthermore, comprehensive insurance coverage, skilled healthcare professionals, and strong patient advocacy contribute to higher diagnosis and treatment rates.

## Competitive Landscape and Industry Innovations

The competitive landscape of the myomectomy market is marked by **strategic partnerships**, **technological innovation**, and **global expansion**. Leading companies are investing in advanced surgical tools that enhance precision, reduce recovery time, and improve patient outcomes.
